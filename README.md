# Connecting Malaysia Population Table from MyDOSM to R
Code to connect Malaysia Populataion data table from MyDOSM API using R

Links to the data: https://open.dosm.gov.my/data-catalogue/population_malaysia

Currently there's no R code documented to connect the data directly to my RStudio. Thus I decided to create an R code to connect to this data to my RStudio environment. Took me a day to figure out how to do so!
